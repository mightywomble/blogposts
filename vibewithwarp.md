# Warp 2.0 is a very good Vibe Coding Tool

Over the last few weeks I've been on a journey of discovery. For years I've been in IT and there have been tools and apps i'd love to have, I'm however no coder.  AI chatbots have in the short time they have been with us become my own personal developer. 

I've been able to describe what I want to Gemini 2.5 Pro and that has lead to me being able to create tools for my home setup and daily life which peform the functions I need.

Like all journeys, as you walk the path , you learn how to communicate with the AI, its pretty much the same way we should communicate with an actual human developer. Short, direct outcomes, which are built on and easier to debug.

This system is the basis of "**Vibe coding**" and I'm good with it. Its opening the door for a whole cottage industry of applications, tools and each one is going to be useful to someone. 

As with all such technology shifts, there will be bug ridden apps, I do belive however people who are good at this will rise like the cream to the top. As they learn to test, about usability and listen to feedback.

When I started I was using Gemini, I've hit on Python Flask as a language as I'm a big lover of Web Apps. Having **Gemini** present code, copy and paste it into **VSCode** and push this up to a iGitHub branch was working really well. Until..

I started getting longer and longer threads in Gemini (or CoPilot, Claude or chatGPT), the longer the Chat threads got, the more the LLM started to break down, Gemini specifically would stop displaying everyting as Canvas links. It started making mistakes.. and very much found itself looping round the same rat holes.

I tried a Claude Pro subscription, to only find that x5 of little is still a little and ate through the tokens in less than an hour..

I hosted on LM Studio on my MacMini M4 and got some good results however something ws bugging me


What do i like?

Warp analyses my code

Warp interacts directly with my code 

Nothing is being sent to the LLM Creators

Warp is quick

The built in IDE is really handy
